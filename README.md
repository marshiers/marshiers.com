## Design Language
`marshiers.com` lifts inspiration in its design from figures in Nehl and Schlaich's "Airport Wayfinding," particularly Kho Liang Ie and Benno Wissing's "Schiphol Standard." Heavy use of the signature yellow, black, and white are attention-grabbing and not harsh. As a freely available resource on Google Fonts, "Inter" was chosen to be the primary font for the website. The grotesk, Helvetica-esque typography mimicks terminal signage to a T.
